  Example1_Basic_Readings

  To connect the sensor to an Arduino:
  This library supports the sensor using the I2C protocol
  On Qwiic enabled boards simply connnect the sensor with a Qwiic cable and it is set to go
  On non-qwiic boards you will need to connect 4 wires between the sensor and the host board
  (Arduino pin) = (Display pin)
  SCL = SCL on display carrier
  SDA = SDA
  GND = GND
  3.3V = 3.3V

  Serial.print(pressureSensor.getPressure_hPa()); // Get the pressure reading in hPa
