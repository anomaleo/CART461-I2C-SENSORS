[*SparkFun Human Presence Sensor Breakout - AK9753 (Qwiic) (SEN-14349)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14349)

The Qwiic Human Presence Sensor uses the AK975x digital PIR. This sensor uses four sensors with overlapping fields of view in order to detect both human presence and the associated movement of that heat source.
